## About

mmdtool for Cinema 4D.

A plugin for Cinema 4D written in C++ is used to import MikuMikuDance data into Cinema 4D.

## Release

Click the latest version of the plugin under [![](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/AiMiDi/C4D_MMD_Tool)](https://github.com/AiMiDi/C4D_MMD_Tool/releases) to download it

At present, the main maintenance version are R20 and higher, R19 and lower are unsupported.

If there is a problem with selecting multiple-parts when the model is imported, please do not check it.

**If the plugin is installed, please check whether the latest version of C4D is installed (such as R21 is R21.207, R21.115 does not show the upgrade can be used)**

## usage

1. Select the corresponding version of the plugin and place it in the plugins folder under the Cinema 4D installation directory.
